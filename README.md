# TODOS

- Need to finish the projection functions (including a Newton solve method for projecting onto the exponential cone)
- Need to finish the derivative of the projection functions
- finishing up the `compute_derivative` function (calling lsqr and then $D\phi(z)$)
- testing (obviously)
- probably more...my brain is tapping out for the night.
- lots of docstrings and more type hints
